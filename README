Description:
------------
tasta a small USB HID keyboard with just two keys and the
corresponding code to program the ATtiny85.  This is my first
microcontroller/PCB project.  I developed it as a foot switch for
push-to-talk in TeamSpeak as I don't have any spare keys (or fingers)
during gaming.  I fiddled with this on and off over the course of two
years, now it should be ready to do something.


Credits:
--------
PCB and basic code are heavily influenced from other projects, as you
can see in the repository log.  Other parts were rewritten, redone and
rearranged by myself.  Credits where credits are due:

 * VUSB project for USB on Atmel microcontrollers:
   http://www.obdev.at/vusb/

 * VUSB HIDKeys example project for a USB HID compliant keyboard:
   https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/hidkeys.html

 * Information on running a VUSB project without a crystal taken from
   flipwork's 1-Key-keyboard:
   http://blog.flipwork.nl/?x=entry:entry081009-142605

 * better OSCCAL calibration routine taken from here:

 * My PCBs were printed at Hackvana.  I've never done this before and
   everything went right on the first try (well, on the second, I had
   one misnamed file in the rev_0x0002 export, but that's my fault):

Licensing:
----------
The VUSB example projects are licensed under GPL 2 or GPL 3 (you can
choose).  The imported code from flipwork and codeandlife is based on
VUSB projects as well (HIDKeys/EasyLogger), so they're GPL 2/3, too.
My project thus is also GPL 2/3 and everybody's happy.
